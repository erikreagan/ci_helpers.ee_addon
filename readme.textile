h1. CI Helpers

Bring CI Helpers into your EE templates. Full docs coming down the road...


h2. Caveat emptor

*It is not recommended you use this plugin yet on a live site. There could be security implications due to what some of the CI helpers do.*


h2. Compatibility

CI Helpers requires ExpressionEngine 2.1.3 or greater


h2. Installation

* Move the @ci_helper@ folder into your @expressionengine/third_party@ folder


h2. Usage

This add-on is only about 90 minutes old. Don't bend it too much unless you plan to patch/contribute and issue a pull request :)

CI Helpers runs off of a single tag with a few parameters. The key parameters are @helper@ and @function@. As you assumed, @helper@ will be the Helper you want and @function@ is the function within the Helper. To see what helpers and functions are available, familiarize yourself with "CodeIgniter":http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/. 

Sample syntax:

<pre><code>{exp:ci_helpers
    helper="html"
    function="doctype"
    argument[0]="html5"
}
</code></pre>

The above code uses CI's HTML Helper and the Doctype function to create the markup for an HTML5 doctype declaration. This is the output:

<pre><code><!DOCTYPE html>
</code></pre>

There's more cool stuff to document, but I need to go to a meeting. I'm just throwing it up on GitHub for now.


h2. Todo

* Create list of "unsafe" functions and disable them
* Add in helper file check so as to avoid the core @show_error()@ display if one doesn't exist
* Add in template logging for helper/function checking & argument passing
